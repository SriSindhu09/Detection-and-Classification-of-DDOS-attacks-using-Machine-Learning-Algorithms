# Detection-and-Classification-of-DDOS-attacks-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
## Project Overview:

The "Detection and Classification of DDoS Attacks using Machine Learning Algorithms" project aims to develop a robust system capable of identifying and categorizing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to enhance network security and protect against potential cyber threats.
## Features:

 DDoS Attack Detection: Implementing machine learning models to identify DDoS attacks based on network traffic patterns and anomalies.
 
 Attack Classification: Categorizing detected attacks into different types (e.g., UDP flood, SYN flood) to aid in threat mitigation.
 
 Real-time Monitoring: Providing real-time monitoring and alerts to promptly respond to active attacks.
 
 Performance Optimization: Optimizing the system to efficiently handle large-scale network traffic and minimize false positives.

## Technologies Used:

 Machine Learning: Utilizing various algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc., to build predictive models.
 
 Python: Developing the project using Python for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
 
 Data Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize network traffic patterns and model performance.
